/*
 * Function: mosquitto_opts_set
 *
 * Used to set options for the client.
 *
 * This function is deprecated, the replacement <mosquitto_int_option>,
 * <mosquitto_string_option> and <mosquitto_void_option> functions should
 * be used instead.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	mosq -   a valid mosquitto instance.
 *	option - the option to set.
 *	value -  the option specific value.
 *
 * Options:
 *	MOSQ_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION - Value must be an int, set to either
 *	          MQTT_PROTOCOL_V31 or MQTT_PROTOCOL_V311. Must be set
 *	          before the client connects.
 *	          Defaults to MQTT_PROTOCOL_V31.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX - Pass an openssl SSL_CTX to be used when creating
 *	          TLS connections rather than libmosquitto creating its own.
 *	          This must be called before connecting to have any effect.
 *	          If you use this option, the onus is on you to ensure that
 *	          you are using secure settings.
 *	          Setting to NULL means that libmosquitto will use its own SSL_CTX
 *	          if TLS is to be used.
 *	          This option is only available for openssl 1.1.0 and higher.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX_WITH_DEFAULTS - Value must be an int set to 1 or 0.
 *	          If set to 1, then the user specified SSL_CTX passed in using
 *	          MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX will have the default options applied to it.
 *	          This means that you only need to change the values that are
 *	          relevant to you. If you use this option then you must configure
 *	          the TLS options as normal, i.e. you should use
 *	          <mosquitto_tls_set> to configure the cafile/capath as a minimum.
 *	          This option is only available for openssl 1.1.0 and higher.

libmosq_EXPORT int mosquitto_opts_set(struct mosquitto *mosq, enum mosq_opt_t option, void *value);

/*
 * Function: mosquitto_int_option
 *
 * Used to set integer options for the client.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	mosq -   a valid mosquitto instance.
 *	option - the option to set.
 *	value -  the option specific value.
 *
 * Options:
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TCP_NODELAY - Set to 1 to disable Nagle's algorithm on client
 *	          sockets. This has the effect of reducing latency of individual
 *	          messages at the potential cost of increasing the number of
 *	          packets being sent.
 *	          Defaults to 0, which means Nagle remains enabled.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION - Value must be set to either MQTT_PROTOCOL_V31,
 *	          MQTT_PROTOCOL_V311, or MQTT_PROTOCOL_V5. Must be set before the
 *	          client connects.  Defaults to MQTT_PROTOCOL_V311.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM - Value can be set between 1 and 65535 inclusive,
 *	          and represents the maximum number of incoming QoS 1 and QoS 2
 *	          messages that this client wants to process at once. Defaults to
 *	          20. This option is not valid for MQTT v3.1 or v3.1.1 clients.
 *	          Note that if the MQTT_PROP_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM property is in the
 *	          proplist passed to mosquitto_connect_v5(), then that property
 *	          will override this option. Using this option is the recommended
 *	          method however.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_SEND_MAXIMUM - Value can be set between 1 and 65535 inclusive,
 *	          and represents the maximum number of outgoing QoS 1 and QoS 2
 *	          messages that this client will attempt to have "in flight" at
 *	          once. Defaults to 20.
 *	          This option is not valid for MQTT v3.1 or v3.1.1 clients.
 *	          Note that if the broker being connected to sends a
 *	          MQTT_PROP_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM property that has a lower value than
 *	          this option, then the broker provided value will be used.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX_WITH_DEFAULTS - If value is set to a non zero value,
 *	          then the user specified SSL_CTX passed in using MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX
 *	          will have the default options applied to it. This means that
 *	          you only need to change the values that are relevant to you.
 *	          If you use this option then you must configure the TLS options
 *	          as normal, i.e.  you should use <mosquitto_tls_set> to
 *	          configure the cafile/capath as a minimum.
 *	          This option is only available for openssl 1.1.0 and higher.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TLS_OCSP_REQUIRED - Set whether OCSP checking on TLS
 *	          connections is required. Set to 1 to enable checking,
 *	          or 0 (the default) for no checking.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TLS_USE_OS_CERTS - Set to 1 to instruct the client to load and
 *	          trust OS provided CA certificates for use with TLS connections.
 *	          Set to 0 (the default) to only use manually specified CA certs.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_DISABLE_SOCKETPAIR - By default, each client connected will create
 *            an internal pair of connected sockets to allow the network thread
 *            to be notified and woken up if another thread calls
 *            <mosquitto_publish> or other similar command. If you are
 *            operating with an external loop, this is not necessary and
 *            consumes an extra two sockets per client. Set this option to 1 to
 *            disable the use of the socket pair.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TRANSPORT - Have the client connect with either MQTT over TCP as
 *	          normal, or MQTT over WebSockets. Set the value to MOSQ_T_TCP or
 *	          MOSQ_T_WEBSOCKETS.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_HTTP_HEADER_SIZE - Size the size of buffer that will be allocated
 *	          to store the incoming HTTP header when using Websocket transport.
 *	          Defaults to 4096. Setting to below 100 will result in a return
*	          value of MOSQ_ERR_INVAL. This should be set before starting the
*	          connection. If you try to set this when the initial http request
*	          is underway then it will return MOSQ_ERR_INVAL.

/*
 * Function: mosquitto_string_option
 *
 * Used to set const char* options for the client.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	mosq -   a valid mosquitto instance.
 *	option - the option to set.
 *	value -  the option specific value.
 *
 * Options:
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TLS_ENGINE - Configure the client for TLS Engine support.
 *	          Pass a TLS Engine ID to be used when creating TLS
 *	          connections. Must be set before <mosquitto_connect>.
 *	          Must be a valid engine, and note that the string will not be used
 *	          until a connection attempt is made so this function will return
 *	          success even if an invalid engine string is passed.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TLS_KEYFORM - Configure the client to treat the keyfile
 *	          differently depending on its type.  Must be set
 *	          before <mosquitto_connect>.
 *	          Set as either "pem" or "engine", to determine from where the
 *	          private key for a TLS connection will be obtained. Defaults to
 *	          "pem", a normal private key file.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TLS_ENGINE_KPASS_SHA1 - Where the TLS Engine requires the use of
 *	          a password to be accessed, this option allows a hex encoded
 *	          SHA1 hash of the private key password to be passed to the
 *	          engine directly. Must be set before <mosquitto_connect>.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TLS_ALPN - If the broker being connected to has multiple
 *	          services available on a single TLS port, such as both MQTT
 *	          and WebSockets, use this option to configure the ALPN
 *	          option for the connection.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_BIND_ADDRESS - Set the hostname or ip address of the local network
 *	          interface to bind to when connecting.

/*
 * Function: mosquitto_reconnect_delay_set
 *
 * Control the behaviour of the client when it has unexpectedly disconnected in
 * <mosquitto_loop_forever> or after <mosquitto_loop_start>. The default
 * behaviour if this function is not used is to repeatedly attempt to reconnect
 * with a delay of 1 second until the connection succeeds.
 *
 * Use reconnect_delay parameter to change the delay between successive
 * reconnection attempts. You may also enable exponential backoff of the time
 * between reconnections by setting reconnect_exponential_backoff to true and
 * set an upper bound on the delay with reconnect_delay_max.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *	delay=2, delay_max=10, exponential_backoff=False
 *	Delays would be: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, ...
 *
 * Example 2:
 *	delay=3, delay_max=30, exponential_backoff=True
 *	Delays would be: 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 30, ...
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  mosq -                          a valid mosquitto instance.
 *  reconnect_delay -               the number of seconds to wait between
 *                                  reconnects.
 *  reconnect_delay_max -           the maximum number of seconds to wait
 *                                  between reconnects.
 *  reconnect_exponential_backoff - use exponential backoff between
 *                                  reconnect attempts. Set to true to enable
 *                                  exponential backoff.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS - on success.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_INVAL -   if the input parameters were invalid.

 * Function: mosquitto_max_inflight_messages_set
 *
 * This function is deprected. Use the <mosquitto_int_option> function with the
 * MOSQ_OPT_SEND_MAXIMUM option instead.
 *
 * Set the number of QoS 1 and 2 messages that can be "in flight" at one time.
 * An in flight message is part way through its delivery flow. Attempts to send
 * further messages with <mosquitto_publish> will result in the messages being
 * queued until the number of in flight messages reduces.
 *
 * A higher number here results in greater message throughput, but if set
 * higher than the maximum in flight messages on the broker may lead to
 * delays in the messages being acknowledged.
