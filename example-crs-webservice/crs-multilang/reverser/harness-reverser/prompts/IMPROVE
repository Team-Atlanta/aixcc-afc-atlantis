From a software engineering expert's perspective,
please improve the testlang to make more parts testable or populate `possible_values` with values that are meaningful based on the code and can be used for effective testing.
Do not remove any existing `possible_values`; only add or refine them with values that make sense in context.
Please provide the testlang in JSON5 format between <testlang> and </testlang> at the end of the message, without comments.
