    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"SETTING: You are an autonomous
      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current
      directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought
      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"}],"model":"gpt-4o","temperature":0.3,"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"bash","description":"runs

      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current
      directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought
      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"SETTING: You are an autonomous
      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current
      directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought
      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"SETTING: You are an autonomous
      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current
      directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought
      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"SETTING: You are an autonomous
      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current
      directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought
      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE

      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE

      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive

      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      You are an autonomous programmer, and you''re working directly in the command
      line with a special interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor
      that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands,
      you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo
      call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease
      note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you
      are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you
      want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current
      directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought
      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_b'' to ''function_badc0de''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"}],"model":"gpt-4o","temperature":0.3,"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"bash","description":"runs

      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current

      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able

      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run

      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      You are an autonomous programmer, and you''re working directly in the command

      that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands,
      you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo
      call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease
      note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you
      are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you
      want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current

      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_b'' to ''function_badc0de''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking

      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou

      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =

      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you
      are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you
      want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou

      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_b'' to ''function_badc0de''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_a'' to ''function_deadbeef''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      You are an autonomous programmer, and you''re working directly in the command

      you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo
      call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease
      note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you
      are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you
      want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE

      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive

      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =

      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      are now looking at the relevant section of the `fields.py` file where the `TimeDelta`
      serialization occurs. The issue suggests that there is a rounding problem near
      line 1474. The current implementation uses integer division, which truncates
      the decimal part and can lead to incorrect rounding on line 1475. To fix this
      issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_b'' to ''function_badc0de''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current

      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To

      call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease
      note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you
      are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you
      want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nchange the function name from ''func_b'' to ''function_badc0de''\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files that you want.\nRemember,
      YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen
      you''re satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your
      changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however
      that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this
      environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
      script and then run it with the python command.\nYou are not able to reproduce
      the bug or run the tests! Always double-check that your changes don''t break
      any existing functionality after you''ve made them by carefully reading the
      code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a
      command and it doesn''t work, try running a different command. A command that
      did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2.
      If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is
      not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just use the scroll_down command
      multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It''s much quicker.\n\n3.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write
      code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code
      after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
      If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5. When editing files, first
      explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain
      the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit
      does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try to install any packages
      with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment
      is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code
      or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7. Locate relevant
      code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use
      the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think you''ve fixed the
      bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t break any existing
      functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file and perform further
      edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To
