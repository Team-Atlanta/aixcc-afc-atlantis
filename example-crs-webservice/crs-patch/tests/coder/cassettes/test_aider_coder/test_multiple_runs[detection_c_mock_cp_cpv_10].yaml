      or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need
      to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container
      markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding

      move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from

      which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you
      to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE

      section\n- The new file''s contents in the `REPLACE` section\n\nTo rename files

      probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just
      proposed.\nThe user will say when they''ve applied your edits. If they haven''t
