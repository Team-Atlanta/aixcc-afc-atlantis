      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current
      directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought
      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      Do not use fuzzer-specific macros/flags in the patch.\n- Do not remove assert

      \n\n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you''re going to solve this issue on your own.
      Your terminal session has started and you''re in the repository''s root directory.
      You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all
      the files that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL
      CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you''re satisfied with all of the changes
      you''ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running
      the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session
      commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and
      run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python
      command.\nYou are not able to reproduce the bug or run the tests! Always double-check
      that your changes don''t break any existing functionality after you''ve made
      them by carefully reading the code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE
      ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make
      sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT
      TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a different
      command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless
      you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a
      specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just
      use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file
      and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open
      file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working
      directory! Note that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they
      might change the current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to
      accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes.
      Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects
      what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5.
      When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing
      the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem.
      Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try
      to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually
      not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without
      executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7.
      Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you
      want to edit. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think
      you''ve fixed the bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t
      break any existing functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file
      and perform further edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"}],"model":"gpt-4o","temperature":0.3,"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"bash","description":"runs

      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current

      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      Your terminal session has started and you''re in the repository''s root directory.
      You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all
      the files that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL
      CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you''re satisfied with all of the changes
      you''ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running
      the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session
      commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and
      run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python
      command.\nYou are not able to reproduce the bug or run the tests! Always double-check
      that your changes don''t break any existing functionality after you''ve made
      them by carefully reading the code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE
      ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make
      sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT
      TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a different
      command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless
      you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a
      specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just
      use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file
      and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open
      file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working
      directory! Note that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they
      might change the current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to
      accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes.
      Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects
      what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5.
      When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing
      the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem.
      Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try
      to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually
      not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without
      executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7.
      Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you
      want to edit. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think
      you''ve fixed the bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t
      break any existing functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file
      and perform further edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The

      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou

      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE

      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able

      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      \n\n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you''re going to solve this issue on your own.
      Your terminal session has started and you''re in the repository''s root directory.
      You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all
      the files that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL
      CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you''re satisfied with all of the changes
      you''ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running
      the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session
      commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and
      run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python
      command.\nYou are not able to reproduce the bug or run the tests! Always double-check
      that your changes don''t break any existing functionality after you''ve made
      them by carefully reading the code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE
      ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make
      sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT
      TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a different
      command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless
      you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a
      specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just
      use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file
      and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open
      file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working
      directory! Note that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they
      might change the current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to
      accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes.
      Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects
      what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5.
      When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing
      the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem.
      Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try
      to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually
      not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without
      executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7.
      Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you
      want to edit. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think
      you''ve fixed the bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t
      break any existing functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file
      and perform further edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"SETTING: You are an autonomous
      programmer, and you''re working directly in the command line with a special
      interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you
      100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can
      also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command,
      you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE
      EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking
      at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit
      the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou
      search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note
      the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same
      result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE
      FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current
      directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought
      about what you''re going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include
      exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include
      a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell
      before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include
      in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you''d like
      to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit
      just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you''ll be able
      to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive
      session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them."},{"role":"user","content":"We''re
      currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here''s the issue
      text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found
      quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom
      marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field
      = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] =
      timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput
      of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like
      a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow,
      you''re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started
      and you''re in the repository''s root directory. You can use any bash commands
      or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run
      any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND
      AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you''re
      satisfied with all of the changes you''ve made, you can submit your changes
      to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you
      cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment,
      but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and
      then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND:
      Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate
      indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying
      to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code
      for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment,
      and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix
      it.\n  When you think you''ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script
      to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction
      script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding
      a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of
      the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the
      way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a
      different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second
      time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area
      around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t
      just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading
      a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you''d like to understand how
      to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether
      someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file
      \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn''t work, use the linux ''find'' command.\n\n5.
      Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working
      directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently
      open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note
      that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they might change the
      current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify
      a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check
      the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted
      to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file:

      \n\n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you''re going to solve this issue on your own.
      Your terminal session has started and you''re in the repository''s root directory.
      You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all
      the files that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL
      CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you''re satisfied with all of the changes
      you''ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running
      the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session
      commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and
      run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python
      command.\nYou are not able to reproduce the bug or run the tests! Always double-check
      that your changes don''t break any existing functionality after you''ve made
      them by carefully reading the code and thinking about how it will be executesd.\n\nNOTE
      ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make
      sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT
      TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn''t work, try running a different
      command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless
      you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a
      specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don''t just
      use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command.
      It''s much quicker.\n\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file
      and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open
      file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working
      directory! Note that some commands, such as ''create'', open files, so they
      might change the current open file.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to
      accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes.
      Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects
      what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn''t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n5.
      When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing
      the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem.
      Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.\n\n6. Do not try
      to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually
      not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without
      executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\n7.
      Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you
      want to edit. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n8. When you think
      you''ve fixed the bug, make sure that the code is correct and that it doesn''t
      break any existing functionality. If you find any issues, go back to the file
      and perform further edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mock-cp-src)\nbash-$"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The
