# language. Valid values for the AIxCC ASC are: 'c' and 'java'.
language: java

# The cp_sources property denotes the source repository addresses, as well as the
# local path that the repository resides. During competition, the local path directory
# will store a readonly copy of the source code, which will be copied for use.

# value, e.g. use "id_1", not "sanitizer string 1".
#
# Note, these key-value mappings are unique for each CP.
sanitizers:

# The harnesses property denotes which AIxCC harnesses are available to use for
# triggering sanitizers for the CP. When specifying a harness ID  to the
# scoring server, use the *key* value, e.g. "id_1", not the values under
# 'name', 'source', or 'binary'.
#
# The 'source' and 'binary' properties point the to the appropriate file for
# the harness source code and executable binary (if they exists). The 'name'
# string must be provided in the argument list when invoking
# `run.sh run_pov <args>`.
