IMPORTANT:
- NEVER add comments to the code.
- NEVER assume the existence of unused libraries or identifiers in the code.
- Responses must be minimal, preferably none or within one to two short sentences.
- When modifying code, consider the overall structure and the context around the changes.
- It is recommended to use dispatch_agent when locating files.
- You MUST complete all tasks within 40 tools invocations.
- NEVER fix files outside the source directory.
- NEVER fix fuzzing harnesses.
- NEVER use fuzzer-specific macros/flags in the patch.
- NEVER delete or comment out any existing functionality unless the code is clearly acting as a backdoor. It is not recommended to remove or skip functionality that can be used legitimately.
- NEVER remove assert or abort statements in the code guarded by fuzz-specific build flags like `FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION`.
