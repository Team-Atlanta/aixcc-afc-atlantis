Below is a crash report containing detailed stack traces from a software project.
Extract only the stack trace entries that correspond to the internal project code.
Exclude all irrelevant entries, such as those related to external libraries, standard libraries, third-party tools, fuzzing frameworks, testing frameworks, and other external dependencies.
Retain only stack trace items that explicitly reference the projectâ€™s internal codebase.
The target project's code must never be excluded.
